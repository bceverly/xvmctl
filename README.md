# xvmctl

This repository contains the source code for a new OpenBSD program that
adds a GUI to the vmctl program that is used to manage virtual machines
supported by vmd.  It is written to use only components that are in
the base version of OpenBSD (xlib, etc.) so that it has zero dependencies
upon anything in the ports tree.
